# Java-Rx (Java 'Script)

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

## Description

This is an interactive MERN Stack Single-Page Application that is the culmination of our 6 month coding bootcamp course. Java-Rx uses a MongoDB back end, a GraphQL API, Express.js and Node.js server with a React front end and implements user authenticatoin with JWT tobuild out the full user focused platform. This application is a social media platform that is intended to revolve around coffee. Users can visit this page and get inspiration for new drink recipes from other user's posts. Eventually this application will allow users to search a database of existing coffee drinks, complete with a list of ingredients, instrutions on how to make the delicious beverage, as well as a photo of the finished product. The user will also be able to upload their own drink including a photo of their beverage.
